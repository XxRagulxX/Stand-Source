! Thanks for helping with the translation of Stand into your language!
! Before you begin, I guess you need to know a little about the project so you can work efficiently.
! Lines starting with "# LABEL=" need to be translated except for the "LABEL=" part and to indicate that it has been translated, you need to remove the "# ", which might be a bit annoying at first, but this will become practical for updating the translation.
! There are some things that you shouldn't translate:
! - The name "Stand"
! - Pairs of curly brackets, e.g. {} or {player}
! - Folders or files like %appdata%/Stand/Theme
! - Emojis (unless there's a culturally different meaning)
! - Technical Terms, i.e. anything that would make less sense if translated
! Alright, I think you're ready to unleash your powers now! ;D
